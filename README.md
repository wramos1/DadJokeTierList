# Dad Joke Tier List

Everybody loves a good dad joke. This project uses a Dad Joke API in order to allow users to generate an endless amount of dad jokes. 
With the implementation of HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript, users can have fun assigning the joke into three tiers or they can even create their own dad joke and dictate where their own joke falls within the tiers.
If they feel a dad joke is undeserving of a spot on the tiers, they can simply delete it or they can choose to go back to the drawing board and clear all the lists.

_Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, External API_
